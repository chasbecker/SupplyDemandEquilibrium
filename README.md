# SupplyDemandEquilibrium
Python script - calculate equilibrium quantity, price, surplus, plot the results - from linear S&amp;D functions.
By Chuck Becker for the Fall 2019 semester of ECON381 at Sonoma State University.

Assumptions:
1) the demand slope has a non-zero and negative coefficient;
2) the supply function has a non-zereo and positive coefficient;
3) the demand constant is larger than the supply constant.
